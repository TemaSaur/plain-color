Simply a web page with a plain color

You can use the site for many different purposes. For example, you can use it as a color-picker and see the color in real time in full screen. Or you can lighten up your room with a specific shade you like without needing to buy an LED system. What if you just want to leave your screen with a simple color? You can do it all and your only limit is your imagination

___

To choose the color you can write your color in standard 16-bit format of #rrggbb. Another way is to use the built-in color-picker of your browser (located to the right of the text input)
